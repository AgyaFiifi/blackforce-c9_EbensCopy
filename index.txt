Try as much as possible to use all the tags and attributes we learnt in class on every page
Make sure to use a separate folder in your project to store other pages and images, then link them from your index page.

You’re free to play around with other tags and attributes we didn’t cover in class.
You can decide to do the assignment on any topic of your choice, but it should follow the same guidelines as mentioned above.
