                <h3>Equipment Rental Billing Engine</h3>
                <p>A construction company rents heavy equipment to various project sites, and needs an automated system in Salesforce to calculate 
                    rental charges based on complex rules. The billing must account for rental duration, equipment type, location-based pricing, 
                    discounts for long-term use, and late return penalties. The system should generate accurate billing records, 
                    support recalculations when rental details change, and notify the accounting team.
                    <p>Technologies & Tools:</p>
                        <p>Salesforce Platform, Apex Classes & Triggers for billing logic, Custom Objects for Rental Contracts, Equipment, and Billing Records
                        Batch Apex for monthly billing runs, Email Services for notifications, Visualforce / Lightning PDF Generation for invoices
                        Salesforce Reports & Dashboards for rental and billing summaries.</p>
                        <p>Project Team: Project Manager, Salesforce Developer (Apex), Salesforce Administrator, Business Analyst, QA Tester, and Accounting Representative
                        </p></p>

                <h3>Site Incident Reporting and Risk Scoring System</h3>
                <p>The construction company wants to improve job site safety by tracking and scoring incidents reported by field supervisors. 
                    Each incident (e.g., safety violations, injuries, or near-misses) must be logged in Salesforce, and a custom risk score calculated based on severity, 
                    incident type, and project history. Certain incident types must trigger immediate alerts to safety managers. Due to the complex, weighted scoring model 
                    and escalation rules, the system requires Apex to perform dynamic calculations, generate reports, and support automated safety audits.
                    <p>Technologies & Tools: Salesforce Platform, Custom Objects, Apex Classes & Triggers, Email & SMS Notifications, Scheduled Apex Jobs and Reports & Dashboards.</p>
